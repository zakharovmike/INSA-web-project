# INSA-web-project

Copy of the code that can be found on the initial project repo: [mat42290/Projet-INSA-S1](https://github.com/mat42290/Projet-INSA-S1)

You can see a live version of the site at https://etud.insa-toulouse.fr/~zakharov/ \*

\* Definitely works in Safari, other browsers are hit or miss. Optimizing for all browsers was not the goal of the project.

My specific contributions:
* Layout, styles and interactions of the home page
* Everything in the "Nos offres" page minus the actual university pages
* Fetching university data and university pages from local directory (no server used in the project)
* Small additions and fixes here and there
* README git instructions on project repo: [mat42290/Projet-INSA-S1](https://github.com/mat42290/Projet-INSA-S1)
